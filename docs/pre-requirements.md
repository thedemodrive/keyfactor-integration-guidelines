## Kubernetes (v1.18 at least)

- These steps require you to have a cluster running a compatible version of Kubernetes. You can use any supported platform, for example [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or others specified by the [platform-specific setup instructions](https://istio.io/docs/setup/platform-setup/).
- Require Kubernetes Version > **1.18**

Example with Minikube: minikube start --memory=10000 --cpus=4 --kubernetes-version=1.18.6

## Helm version 3

The Helm project provides two ways to fetch and install Helm. These are the official methods to get Helm releases. In addition to that, the Helm community provides methods to install Helm through different package managers. Installation through those methods can be found below the official methods.
